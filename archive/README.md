# Archive

This folder is for storing an archive of previous scans. It is organized by
files labeled with the timestamp of their start time, e.g.

  2022-10-04_01-31-01.db   
  2022-10-04_01-31-01.log   

This is intended to help with troubleshooting but it can be managed as needed
in the nightly.sh executable or by setting a separate script as a cronjob.
